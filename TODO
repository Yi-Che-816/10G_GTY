Needed:
- Better IP gen flow
- Customise xver quad/lanes
- Build script/gen as per Xilinx IP
- Better module signal names
- File headers
- Handle MAC User Rx not ready - buffer up to end of IPG?
- Document dual rx crc approach
- TX_INT_DATAWIDTH = TX_DATA_WIDTH gearbox seq

Nice to have:
- MAC: Deficit IPG
- 32-bit datapath
- Clearer PCS encoding without functions?
- Fix or note non-standard rx AXIS TUSER when TKEEP = 0
- Payloads less than 48 are padded (rather then min size of 46)
- Way to have 0 latency encoder? (know type byte in advance)
