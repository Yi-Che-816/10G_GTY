Needed:

- Better IP gen flow
- Customise xver quad/lanes
- Build script/gen as per Xilinx IP
    - with custom scripts post synth,place etc?
- Better module signal names
- File headers


Nice to have:
- Handle MAC User Rx not ready - buffer up to end of IPG?
- MAC: Deficit IPG
- Clearer PCS encoding without functions?
- Fix or note non-standard rx AXIS TUSER when TKEEP = 0
- Way to have 0 latency encoder? (know type byte in advance)
- Auto check on mac tb 

Performance:
- Get packet length (term) from MAC pipeline -> use this in PCS to send block type before data received
    - Or passthrough data without buffer as we know first frame?
